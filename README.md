## Execution of code: 
We have used Kaggle platform for the toxicity prediction challenge. we also did our code execution and submission from Kaggle itself. 
We included all our source codes which is in (.ipynb format) and our output file (excel format). 
To Change the platform: 
To execute our source code provided in different platform rather than Kaggle we would prefer jupyter notebook. 

Steps to execute code in jupyter notebook: 
1. Open-source code provided (.ipynb format) in the jupyter notebook. 
2. Upload the train, test and feamat csv in the jupyter notebook OR Change the train, test and feamat datasets address in the code by mentioning their current location in the system. 
3. Save and Run the code. 
 
Using Google Colab Notebook, we can convert it to .py extension and use the file for execution. 

## About the datasets:
1. train.csv : This file contains chemical records which will be used for training the model
2. test.csv: This file contains chemical records which will be used for predicting the chemicals as toxic ("1") or non-toxic ("0")
3. feamat.csv: This file contains the attribute names for different columns in train and test files.
